Todo
====

Todo is a simple light-weight distributed issue tracker that handles what's released on a server.

Why
----
We are lazy. We don't want to manually keep track of releases.

How?
----

Add a bug:
> ruby todo.rb add bug

Generate diff in folder _releasefolder_:
> ruby todo.rb diff _releasefolder_
